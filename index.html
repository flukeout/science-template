            <p>
              Your open project needs users and contributors, but how can you find them,
              get them involved, and keep them engaged and active in your community?
              One way is by creating and using "personas" and "pathways" to help you
            </p>

            <p>
              A “persona” is a tool commonly used in the design world, to help create products
              and experiences that work for real world users (aka “user-centered design”).
              The persona is an imaginary user, based on real-world observations and understandings
               of actual potential or current users. The persona becomes real to the designer,
               and is used as a tool to test ideas and experiences (for example, a designer
               might ask “Would our user persona, Rodrigo, who is an avid photographer and
               technophile but also an introvert who’s protective of his private information,
               like feature x of our social media platform?”).
            </p>

            <p>
              Personas may be composites of several real-world users. The power of the
              persona is in its specificity; a good persona feels real, and helps a designer
              (or project lead) put their own perspectives aside and empathize with the needs
              and motivations of users.
            </p>

                  Rashid is a PhD student in astronomy at a university in Southern England.
                  He’s outgoing and a snappy dresser, favoring skinny jeans and colorful cardigans.
                  He lives in on-campus housing and after a long day at the lab he usually rushes home
                  to see his wife and infant son. Rashid took an intro Java programming course long ago,
                  as an undergrad, but his research now demands Python skills. He attended a two-day
                  Software Carpentry workshop at his institution.

            <h3>About Pathways</h3>

            <p>
              Once we have a persona, we can imagine how they might interact with our project.
              Let's imagine that this process has a few phases.
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li><strong>Discovery</strong> - How they first hear about the project or group.</li>
              <li><strong>First Contact</strong> - How they first engage with the project or group, that intial interaction.</li>
              <li><strong>Participation</strong> - How they first participate or contribute.</li>
              <li><strong>Sustained Participation</strong> - How their contribution or involvement can continue.</li>
              <li><strong>Networked Participation</strong> - How they may network within the community.</li>
              <li><strong>Leadership</strong> - How they may take on some additional responsibility on the project, or begin to lead.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2 id="steps-to-complete">Steps to Complete</h2>

            <ol class="steps">
              <!-- Step 1 -->
              <li>
                <h1>Brainstorm</h1>
                <p>
                  In groups of two, read through the following questions. Take notes! Each person
                   should answer the question in caps in the time provided. Use a timer to keep
                   time for each person.
                </p>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <h2>Who is the person you most need in your community or on your project?</h2>
                    <p class="step-time">3 minutes each</p>
                    <p>
                      Create a persona for this user. Think of the skill set or attributes you want,
                      but ALSO give them a name, age, a place to live, life circumstances (single,
                      married? family? student? mid-career?), what they like and don’t like, etc.
                      This may seem superfluous, but the more real the persona feels to you, the
                      more useful they’ll be. Have fun with this!
                    </p>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <h2>What are that person's motivations and needs?</h2>
                    <p class="step-time">3 minutes each</p>
                    <p>
                      What’s likely to get your persona engaged and excited? What are their personal
                      goals? Why might they be drawn to your project? What might be the value for
                       them— what can they get out of it?
                    </p>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>

              <!-- Step 2 -->
              <li>
                <h1>Write</h1>
                <p class="step-time">3 minutes each</p>
                <p>
                  Create a short description of your persona. See above "Rashid" for an example.
                </p>
              </li>

              <!-- Step 3 -->
              <li>
                <h1>Plan a Pathway</h1>
                <p class="step-time">30 minutes</p>
                <p>
                  Using the structure above, describe a pathway for your persona. What are the steps through
                  this project? What could stumbling blocks for user? What skills, info, or resources are
                  missing that they”ll need to better engage with the project? What kinds of things might
                  drive them away from your project?
                </p>
              </li>
